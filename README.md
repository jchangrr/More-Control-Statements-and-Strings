Exercise 1: Repeat Kiosk problem in previous assignment with the following modifications
-	Use methods.  Each operation is represented by a method
-	Use do – while loop to make sure the kiosk is always ready for further transactions – not just one time run– 
-	If option “4” is entered the program exist.
-	Starting balance is $100.00 

Exercise 2: Write a Java program that contains a method that takes a number (from the user as an input) and prints it in reverse order. That is, if the user enters 123, the program should print 321. 
(you are NOT allowed to use arrays)

Exercise 3: Write program in Java that accepts user’s input and validates if the input (could be a word or more) is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards as it does backwards. For this exercise we will consider a palindrome a palindrome without punctuation. 
Examples of palindromes: My gym, or Top spot, race car

Exercise 4: Write a Java program that converts a decimal number to binary based 2. For instance, 45 in binary is 101101. The decimal number is an input from the user.

Exercise 5: Write a java program that contains two overloaded methods that accepts two numbers or two characters representing a range example (11, 37) or (c, w) inputted by the user. The method generates a random integer within the given range and returns it, or a random char within the given range of chars and returns it. The method needs to be called in the main and the main prints the return of the method.

Exercise 6: Implement a Java program that prints a table of characters that are equivalent to the Ascii codes from 65 to 126 (126 included) (You will need to use int and cast it to char). Your program should print five characters per line.

Exercise 7: Write a program that prompts the user to enter two strings and displays the largest common prefix of the two strings (ignoring the letters case). Here are some sample runs: 
Example:
Enter the first string: Welcome to Java
Enter the second string: Welcome to programming 
The common prefix is: Welcome to 

Example:
Enter the first string: Atlanta 
Enter the second string: Miami
Output: Miami and Atlanta have no common prefix
